<h1>All about clouds</h1>
<h2>Basic info</h2>
  <p>Cloud are things flouting in the sky and white. Sometimes it looks like shapes, 
    other time it stretch like smoke. A cloud gentally move with wind, always changing, 
    and sometimes, when it grows full and heavy, it releases rain, bringing water down to the earth.</p>
<h2>Songs</h2>
  <p>A cloud drifts soft across the sky,<br>
    A wisper on the breeze goes by.<br>
    It gathers dream in the shades of gray,<br>
    Then faddes with light at end of day.
